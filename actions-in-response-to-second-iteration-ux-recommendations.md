# Actions in response to user testing recommendations

## Service homepage

<dl>
    <dt>"users need to know what they need to book and a) what a reader's ticket is b) how to get one/renew one/find ticket number on one"</dt>
    <dd><p>We think there is a need to balance the needs of returning and new users. Having discussed this we think the right home for this information is a separate page that can be linked to from multiple places. In terms of the changes to the application, we think this is best addressed through</p>
    <ul>
        <li>making the introduction content and associated call to action which appears on the Service Homepage more descriptive</li>
        <li>providing a different treatment for the link</li>
        <li>review / create a page that this link goes to (presumably a lot of this information already exists on the site)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Other options might include introducing an additional step or bringing the instructions out onto this page, both of which seem to introduce more problems than they sovle.</p></dd>
    </dd>
    <dt>"'most common choice' not needed - users can decide based on the information presented what they need"</dt>
    <dd>remove this text from the option.</dd>
    <dt>"universal understanding that 'how to book and what to expect' would take take them to a step by step guide to booking (the idiot's guide)"</dt>
    <dd>We should ensure that the page content that is linked to meets user needs and expectations.</dd>
    <dt>"PCs - needs to be more clear why you would book this (Free access to Ancestry/FMP!) and be clear if a reader's ticket would be needed for this."</dt>
    <dd>This section of the page is being removed and will not be included in the MVP for go-live. We should ensure the target page reflects this when re-introduced.</dd>
    <dt>"there is some confusion around one or two day visit - who decides this? TNA/the system/the user? and how does this impact doc ordering and booking allocation per month"</dt>
    <dd>This will become clear when the related business rules for the MVP at go-live are established. The user journey will be simplified if the business rules dictate that a Standard Order is one day and a Bulk Order is two days, but we will have to see what is decided.</dd>
    <dt>"users need to know if there are any restrictions on number of visits booked"</dt>
    <dd>We can highlight key information (such as 'x visits per calendar month') at various places in the interface but feel the details should be included in the 'How to book and what to expect' page. We think that it might be best to include this within the introductory text on the Service Homepage and then, again, on the Availability Page.</dd>
    <dt>"users need to understand WHY any restrictions on bookings are in place"</dt>
    <dd>This detail would be included in the page which is linked to under 'How to book and what to expect'</dd>
    <dt>"T&Cs/covid charter/face mask policy etc  need to be checked - where on this journey?"</dt>
    <dd>We think this should all be available to view before starting the booking process within the 'How to book and what to expect' page. We think it should also be included in the email that confirms their documents are being prepared for their visit.</dd>
    <dt>"clear calls to action that show step by step what user needs to do"</dt>
    <dd>Change 'Find a day to visit' to 'Choose a date'</dd>
    <dt>"users need to see availability 1st so they know whether to spend another minute thinking about booking"</dt>
    <dd>By showing the number of spaces available we are giving an indication of availability before people enter the process.</dd>
    <dt>"need a TNA convention for how we handle archival terms such as series (an 'i' symbol, a link to a glossary...)"</dt>
    <dd>This is a known issue across services. It feels like solving this is beyond the responsibility of the booking system. We recommend introducing the solution to Kew Booking System once it has been identified.</dd>
    <dt>"term standard visit works well"</dt>
    <dd>No further changes needed.</dd>
    <dt>"list of what determines a standard or bulk visit was helpful (apart from word series)"</dt>
    <dd>No changes proposed at present. Refer to point above about handling archival terms.</dd>
    <dt>"availability on the homepage works"</dt>
    <dd>No action necessary at this stage.</dd>
</dl>


## Availability page

<dl>
    <dt>"need to consider business rules (number of days/visits per month etc)  and if we can simplify process as much as possible"</dt>
    <dd>This will become clear when the related business rules for the MVP at go-live are established.</dd>
    <dt>"users understood choosing filters on left and saw feedback in the availability"</dt>
    <dd>No changes needed.</dd>
    <dt>"camera stand option could be more visible"</dt>
    <dd>This may have reflected that it was a wireframe and no visual design had been applied. The design will need to make it somewhat prominent.</dd>
    <dt>"look at label 'map and large doc' and how to express this to users in same way as series ('i' or link etc)"</dt>
    <dd>See above regarding need for TNA to establish pattern for archival terms. For the time being, we propose using the same approach as is used for "Two-day visit" (i.e. explanatory text that appears below the option.)</dd>
    <dt>"users liked/understood the availability but need to refer to business rules around number of weeks shown etc - users want to know how far ahead they can book"</dt>
    <dd>Agreed. Let's see what the business rules are and make any changes necessary (pagination might be an option if we have many to display).</dd>
    <dt>"Confusion around 1 or 2 day visit - this needs to be flushed out and made clear"</dt>
    <dd>This will become clear when the related business rules for the MVP are decided. It might be easier for users to understand if Standard Visits are one day and Bulk Visits are two day.</dd>
    <dt>"Users like seeing what day of the week and number available when making their decision"</dt>
    <dd>Suggest we keep the design as it is for now.</dd>
    <dt>"Many - but not all - saw the bulk order button but most said they would use the back button if they had made a mistake in choosing standard order."</dt>
    <dd>Suggest we keep it as it is.</dd>
</dl>

## Summary and secure booking with readers ticket page

<dl>
    <dt>"users new to TNA do not know what a reader's ticket is (one user even said he usually was GIVEN a ticket number when making a booking never had to provide one himself)"</dt>
    <dd>...</dd>
    <dt>"some users do not know where to find the ticket number on their reader's ticket - we need to give users more guidance  on this"</dt>
    <dd>...</dd>
    <dt>"most users saw the link to register for a reader's ticket but some clarity is sought about how to get a temporary ticket, and whether you would lose your booking if you followed this link (would it open a separate window? how long would to get back to the booking before it times out?)"</dt>
    <dd>...</dd>
    <dt>"some users were surprised by what happened when they clicked 'check ticket details' - this label could do with a tweak more along the lines of verify email associated with this ticket (although one user expected it to say 'welcome back ____! Your reader's ticket is still valid.... and if nearing expiry to prompt to get renewing"</dt>
    <dd>...</dd>
    <dt>"the idea of verifying the reader's ticket/email makes sense to many users though although - esp as a successful booking hinges on email communication"</dt>
    <dd>...</dd>
</dl>

## Booking confirmation page

<dl>
    <dt>"many users were confused with the label 'continue booking now' - they felt they had completed their booking already and felt anxious perhaps they hadn't done it correctly - really they are going to continue to document ordering"</dt>
    <dd>...</dd>
    <dt>"users appreciated the summary at the top and double checked it"</dt>
    <dd>...</dd>
    <dt>"some users were uncertain where these buttons would take them"</dt>
    <dd>...</dd>
    <dt>"users need to know what happens if they don't complete their booking in time"</dt>
    <dd>...</dd>
    <dt>"one user brought up that they expected a booking ref number on this page with the summary in case something gets lost - esp needed if users are making multiple bookings in a month to keep the doc orders and bookings clear (which documents for which days)"</dt>
    <dd>...</dd>
</dl>

## Order documents

**Please note:** a very early version of a proposed approach to document ordering was presented to users so, while aspects of user feedback is useful the next iteration will not be an evolution of what was shown to users.

<dl>
    <dt>"there was confusion around 'number of docs needed' and 'add fields' most users expected the number of fields shown to correspond with the number of documents permitted to order"</dt>
    <dd>We are going to show all fields. There will not be an 'Add fields' button.</dd>
    <dt>"much confusion around the  'reserve'  tick boxes in both panes: is a doc only ordered once I tick reserve and the others are just there for later?"</dt>
    <dd>We are proposing that there will be a separate section of the form for entering reserves. This will have it's own fieldset and legend (title).</dd>
    <dt>"make it clear from this page how to get back to this form to amend"</dt>
    <dd>We will provide a mechanism and explanation so that it is clear users can return to the document order process by clicking the link in their email.</dd>
    <dt>"users understand 'save changes' but some expected an additional page after this with the full, printable, document order and a 'confirm order' button to submit"</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Some of this will rely upon decisions relating the the business rules (i.e. when it closes). We will address this in the next iteration in two ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We will be separating the document order form from the confirmation page</li>
            <li>We will streamline the messaging about the two options: continuing immediately or returning before the deadline is reached</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We have yet to discuss how we might incorporate a 'confirm order'
    </dd>
    <dt>"expectation of a time for the deadline for ordering"</dt>
    <dd>We will add a time (and time zone) to the next iteration. This might be along the lines of 'Midnight (Greenwich Mean Time) on 24 January'</dd>
    <dt>"most users very happy with ability to amend order until deadline - but some experienced users stated they would not need this"</dt>
    <dd>We anticipate this will be addressed by streamlining the about options available to users (see above).</dd>
    <dt>"would be good to  manage expectations about when doc order is actually confirmed and if this will be in time to choose alternates ( will be told if their docs are already reserved for someone else and if they can add more in that case)"</dt>
    <dd>As a starting point, for the MVP release, we will use the same microcopy and field labels (and validation messages) as is used on the current Advance Order and Bulk Order forms.</dd> 
    <dt>"there was some confusion around where you would go to get document references - we need express this clearly"</dt>
    <dd>We'll add some helpful copy that explains </dd>
    <dt>"user expect it to be clear if a doc reference has been 'validated'"</dt>
    <dd>...</dd>
    <dt>"is there a way to change booking and keep doc order if we are booking 4 weeks in advance and something comes up?"</dt>
    <dd>...</dd>
    <dt>"will it be possible to select a seat? when will users be told what seat they have been allocated?"</dt>
    <dd>...</dd>
    <dt>"we will need to clarify comms about next steps for users"</dt>
    <dd>...</dd>
</dl>
