## Feedback to version 0.0.4

| Feedback  | To be addressed in next iteration  | How it has been addressed  |
|---|---|---|
| **Users who need PC access only**: The flow should accommodate users who use reading room PCs to access online resources. These users will not need a reader's ticket or to order documents. |||
| **Temporary reader's tickets**: Temporary reader's tickets expire after 6 weeks. Is there potential for a user's temporary ticket to expire before they can get a place? How would we accommodate this. One option could be to look into extending the time for temporary reader's tickets |||
| **2 consecutive day visits**: These are not confined to users making a bulk order. They can also be for people who want two consecutive days of advance orders. |||
| **Flexibility for multi-day visits**: There should be some flexibility to allow for, say, 3 day visits should that option become available in future. ||| 
| **Should we provide guidance based on probable need?** This would involve determining how many days are _probably_ needed (based on the number of documents ordered) then showing the user availability and letting them choose. ||| 
| **Link in to Elsa**: Because the Elsa frontend is written in Flash (which is end of life) this should link in with Elsa meaning it would have real long-term viabiity. |||
| **Onsite vs online**: We need to consider different flows depending on the user being onsite or online. |||
| **Camera stand availability**: This might be a deal-breaker for some people - should we ask the question earlier. |||
| **Open with 'Choose your seat'**: Can we have choose your seat at the very beginning of the journey? ||| 
| **Build in flexibility**: Build the system so that we can modify quite easily how many consecutive days someone can book for |||
| **Hold the seat**: We need to hold the seat for people while they complete the process |||
| **Alternative availability**: If there is nothing available for the user as a result of their stated preferences (for example, a camera stand) we should show them what is available instead (for example, there are seats without a camera stand) |||
| **Register needs in advance**: Can users register their needs in advance so that availability which is specific to their needs can be shown up front (Note: this might require a link to a user account which is a bigger project) |||
| **Knowledge at first screen**: Does a user necessarily know their document needs when they arrive at the first screen? Might we need to have 'basket' type functionality in Discovery |||
| **Readers ticket - third option**: It is possible a user might have a readers ticket but that it has expired. ||| 
| **Availability on first page**: By showing availability of the first page will users expect to click on the options shown. |||
